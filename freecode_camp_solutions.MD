// This is an in-line comment.

## exercise2 
```js
//Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.
var myName;
```
 ## exercise3
 
```js
/*In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.

myVariable = 5;

This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
This assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.*/

//Assign the value 7 to variable a. Assign the contents of a to variable b.
var a = 7;
var b = a;
```
## exercise4 
```js
/*It is common to initialize a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

var myVar = 0;

Creates a new variable called myVar and assigns it an initial value of 0.*/
//Define a variable a with var and initialize it to a value of 9.
var a = 9;
```
## exercise5 
```js
/*When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".*/
//Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
```
## exercise6 
```js
/*In JavaScript all variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

MYVAR is not the same as MyVar nor myvar. It is possible to have multiple distinct variables with the same name but different casing. It is strongly recommended that for the sake of clarity, you do not use this language feature.

Best Practice
Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Examples:

var someVariable;
var anotherVariableName;
var thisVariableNameIsSoLong;*/
//Modify the existing declarations and assignments so their names use camelCase.
//Do not create any new variables.
// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
```
